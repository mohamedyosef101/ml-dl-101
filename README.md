# The foundations of Machine Learning and Deep Learning
We all know how much machine learning is important now. And, as always, to get into any field, you need to stand on a solid ground and be well equipped with the foundational concepts. For that reason, I created this repo and a literature review paper with the same title; "[The foundations of ML and DL](mohamedyosef101.github.io/publication/ml-dl-101)". So, my recommendation is to read the paper first and understand the concepts in some kind of *abstract* level then go to play with the code implementations.

**You can cite the paper as:**
> Mohamed Yosef. The foundations of machine learning and deep learning, Apr 2024. URL [mohamedyosef101.github.io/publication/ml-dl-101](mohamedyosef101.github.io/publication/ml-dl-101)

<br>

For the next couple of days, I will start implementing the concepts in the paper--as well as updating the paper itself--to get you to stand on that solid group in this AI era.
